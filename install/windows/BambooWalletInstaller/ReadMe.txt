Hello tangram user, this is a small read me file to help you get going with your bamboo wallet cli installation.

Just accept the licence agreement and click next. Upon completion, you can open up a cmd shell and type: clibamwallet or simply use the shortcut under Bamboo Wallet in the start menu.

If you're deploying per command line you can install the wallet like this:

msiexec /i <cypher_node_installer>.msi /quiet /qn /norestart ADDLOCAL=ALL

Uninstalling

Just use the add/remove program app of windows and search for Bamboo Wallet
